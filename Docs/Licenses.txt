External dependencies

No guarantee this list is accurate, please check the licenses of the individual
projects.

* ffmpeg: LGPL with some parts GPLv2
* glew: Modified BSD + Mesa 3-D + Khronos License (all of them seem MITish to me)
* IXWebSocket: BSD
* jsoncpp: public domain or MIT depending on the jurisdiction
* libjpeg: some permissive license
* libmad: GPL
* libpng: something permissive
* libtomcrypt: public domain or do-what-the-fuck-you-want-public-license depending on jurisdiction
* libtommath: public domain or something permissive
* lua: MIT
* mbedtls: Apache-2.0 or GPLv2
* miniz: MIT
* ogg: BSD
* pcre: BSD
* vorbis: BSD
* zlib: under the zlib license

When building a full release with all the libraries above, the resulting
binares are probably some frankensteinish Apache-2.0/GPLv2/GPLv3/zlib
monstrosity. Please don't sue us! :)
