## Installation

You can choose between using the installer or using the portable build. Using the installer is recommended, because it makes upgrading to new versions easier.

### Windows

**Windows 7 is the minimum supported version.**

 * You will likely have to manually allow the installer to start.

### macOS

**macOS users need to have macOS 11 (Big Sur) or higher to run ITGmania.**
* Move ITGmania.app to the Applications folder, and then run the following command in Terminal:
   * `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ITGmania`
* You should then add ITGmania to the "Input Monitoring" section of System Preferences (under Security & Privacy)

### Linux

**Linux users should receive all they need from the package manager of their choice.**

* **Debian-based**:

  * `sudo apt install libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0 libgl1 libglu1-mesa libglvnd0 libgtk-3-0 libusb-0.1-4 libxinerama1 libxtst6`

* **Fedora-based**:

  * `sudo yum install gdk-pixbuf2 mesa-libGLU gtk3 libusb-compat-0.1 libXinerama libXtst`

*  **Arch Linux**:

   * `sudo pacman install mesa gtk3 libusb-compat libxinerama libxtst llvm-libs`

* **OpenSUSE**:

   * `sudo zypper install libGLU1`
